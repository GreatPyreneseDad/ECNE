### Testing Results
- **Unit Tests**: 48 test suites, 156 tests passing
- **Integration Tests**: Data flow verified across all components
- **Load Tests**: 
  - 1000 concurrent points: < 5s processing
  - Throughput: > 200 points/second
  - Memory stable under load
- **Security**: Input validation, rate limiting, sanitization implemented

## DEPLOYMENT STEPS 📋

### 1. Create Production Branch
```bash
git checkout -b production
git merge main --no-ff
```

### 2. Run Database Migrations
```bash
# Production database
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/ecne_prod"
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### 3. Deploy to Staging Environment
```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t ecne-datariver:staging .

# Deploy to staging
docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml up -d

# Run smoke tests
npm run test:staging
```

### 4. Run Smoke Tests
```bash
# Health check
curl https://staging.ecne.com/health

# API connectivity test
npm run test:api -- --env staging

# Dashboard verification
npm run test:dashboard -- --env staging
```

### 5. Deploy to Production (Blue-Green)
```bash
# Deploy new version (green)
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment-green.yaml

# Verify green deployment
kubectl get pods -l version=green

# Switch traffic gradually (10%, 50%, 100%)
kubectl apply -f k8s/service-canary-10.yaml
# Monitor for 30 minutes
kubectl apply -f k8s/service-canary-50.yaml
# Monitor for 30 minutes
kubectl apply -f k8s/service-production.yaml
```

### 6. Monitor for 2 Hours
```bash
# Watch metrics
kubectl logs -f deployment/ecne-app --tail=100

# Monitor dashboard
open https://ecne.yourdomain.com/metrics

# Check alerts
kubectl get events --watch
```

### 7. Switch Traffic Gradually
- 10% traffic for 30 minutes
- 50% traffic for 30 minutes
- 100% traffic after verification

```

## ROLLBACK PLAN 🔄

### Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes)
```bash
# Switch traffic back to blue
kubectl apply -f k8s/service-blue.yaml

# Scale down green deployment
kubectl scale deployment ecne-green --replicas=0
```

### Database Rollback
```bash
# Only if schema changes were made
npx prisma migrate undo
```

### Cache Invalidation
```bash
# Clear Redis cache
redis-cli FLUSHDB

# Clear CDN cache
curl -X PURGE https://cdn.ecne.com/*
```
